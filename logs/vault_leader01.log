WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variable:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://192.168.2.11:8200'

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: KKR1z2c92UlDlol9KqhQ79B/tUK0fPOYk7BIAFxbKwQ=
Root Token: 997e125a-df4e-d6c2-bd4b-607898a570e0

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!
